# Olympic Data Analysis

## Overview

This project performs **data analysis and visualization** on Olympic Games datasets. It aims to uncover trends and insights about countries, athletes, events, and medal distributions over time.

## Features

* Explore Olympic data using **pandas**.
* Visualize trends with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
* Analyze:

  * Total medals per country.
  * Top athletes.
  * Medal trends across years.
  * Gender distribution in events.
* Identify patterns in **summer and winter Olympics**.

## Dataset

* The dataset contains the following columns:

  * `Athlete` : Name of the athlete
  * `Age` : Age of the athlete
  * `Country` : Country represented
  * `Year` : Year of the Olympic Games
  * `Sport` : Sport or event category
  * `Event` : Specific event
  * `Medal` : Medal won (Gold/Silver/Bronze/None)

* You can use publicly available Olympic datasets from Kaggle or other sources.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical computations
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run your analysis script (e.g., `olympic_analysis.py`):

```bash
python olympic_analysis.py
```

### Example Insights

* Top 10 countries by total medals.
* Medal trend over years for a selected country.
* Top athletes in terms of medals won.
* Gender participation ratio in different sports.

## Future Enhancements

* Interactive dashboards using **Plotly** or **Dash**.
* Predict future medal winners using **machine learning**.
* Include **heatmaps** to show medal distribution globally.
* Analyze **age and performance correlation**.
